			<h2>Redlining in Boston</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Is there a geographic pattern to redlining in the Greater Boston area?</b> - The background reading states that the HOLC created a uniform system of neighborhood grades that color-coded segments of major cities (Catherine Elton, 2020). The text highlights that sections of Roxbury were rated "hazardous" despite having good transportation and job proximity, while neighborhoods in suburbs like Milton were rated "still desirable". Investigating the spatial distribution will help visualize if the government's policy systematically targeted dense urban centers while favoring the "suburban home-building spree" mentioned in the text. From previous classes I have taken like 'The Ghetto', I have seen it is common to segregate minority populations into under-maintained, high density city centers while majorities move out to suburbs, practically segregating by flight.</li>
				<li><b>How does the presence of industrial or commercial zoning correlate with the HOLC grades assigned to residential areas?</b> - The reading explains that redlined neighborhoods were often made to be "bad neighborhoods" where buildings were allowed to deteriorate and slumlords thrived. I am interested in seeing if these low grades were geographically tied to industrial sites, which might have lowered the perceived "security" of the investment for the HOLC. Also, location-wise it made sense to me that low-income and minority populations might work in more industrial areas rather than commercial so there might be some relationship with proximity to these areas.</li>
				<li><b>Are there any disparities in HOLC grade distribution between City of Boston and its surrounding municipalities?</b> - According to the reading, FHA-insured homes in the suburbs were overwhelmingly occupied by white people (over 98%), while Black residents were located in specific city neighborhoods. The text explicitly mentions that by 1970, all of Boston's suburbs were about 98 percent white. By investigating the city and grade fields in the dataset, I can explore if the "Desirable" ratings were disproportionately allocated to the exclusionary suburbs mentioned as "90 percent white" in the background reading.</li>

					<strong>Initial Grade Assessment:</strong> This exploration categorizes the HOLC grades present in the Greater Boston dataset. Grades range from 'A' (Best) to 'D' (Hazardous). The majority of neighborhoods fall within the B and C range, while 'A' and 'D' grades are less frequent. Traditional redlining colors—Green (A), Blue (B), Yellow (C), and Red (D)—are utilized here and throughout the study to remain consistent with historical mapping standards. There seems to be 'Null' values present due to non-residential areas that need to be filtered out in the subsequent visuals.

					<strong>Land Use Characterization:</strong> While the dataset is predominantly comprised of residential zones, it also identifies dedicated industrial and commercial areas. These industrial sectors are critical for evaluating spatial correlation, as historical HOLC guidelines often viewed manufacturing proximity as a "detrimental influence" on residential security.

					<strong>Spatial Distribution of Risk:</strong> A regional overview reveals a clear geographic gradient in grading. Neighborhoods in the city center are overwhelmingly graded lower than those on the periphery. This supports the hypothesis that proximity to the urban core was inversely correlated with investment security in the eyes of the HOLC.

				<figcaption>
					<strong>Urban Core vs. Suburban Contrast:</strong> This side-by-side comparison highlights the stark disparity between the City of Boston and a typical suburb like Winchester. In <strong>Boston</strong>, only <strong>2.6%</strong> of neighborhoods received an 'A' grade, while <strong>30.7%</strong> were redlined as 'D'. In contrast, <strong>Winchester</strong> is composed entirely of 'A' (A1, A2) and 'B' (B1-B6) grades, with <strong>0%</strong> of its area graded 'C' or 'D'. This spatial pattern intentionally incentivized suburban flight for those eligible for bank loans, while trapping minority and lower-income populations in disinvested urban centers.

				<figcaption>
					<strong>Quantitative Comparison of Urban and Suburban Grading:</strong> This normalized bar chart provides a proportional comparison across all cities. It confirms that inner-ring cities like <strong>Chelsea</strong> and <strong>Everett</strong> are dominated by 'C' and 'D' grades, while affluent suburbs like <strong>Arlington</strong> and <strong>Lexington</strong> maintain majority 'A' and 'B' distributions. This visualization removes the distraction of number of district present in the cities through the normalization.

				<img src="./visuals/distance_to_industrial.png" alt="Boxplot: Distance to Industry by Grade">
				<figcaption>
					<strong>The "Spatial Penalty" of Industrial Proximity:</strong> This analysis measures the physical distance between residential neighborhoods and the nearest industrial zone. A clear trend emerges: the lower the grade, the closer the neighborhood sits to industry.
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Redlined (D) Proximity:</strong> Neighborhoods graded 'D' have a median distance of <strong>0.0 miles</strong> from industrial zones, meaning over half are directly adjacent to factories.</li>
						<li><strong>Premium (A) Insulation:</strong> Neighborhoods graded 'A' maintain a median "insulation" distance of <strong>1.78 miles</strong> from industrial activity.</li>
					</ul>
					While variance exists in the 'B' and 'C' categories, the mean distance to industry drops by over <strong>50%</strong> when moving from an 'A' grade (1.95 miles) to a 'D' grade (0.95 miles).

				<img src="./visuals/industrial_grades.jpg" alt="Industrial Intersection in Boston">
				<figcaption>
					<strong>Spacial Adjacency in the Urban Core:</strong> Zooming into Boston, the relationship between labor and geography is visible. Every residential district directly touching an industrial zone is graded 'C' or 'D'. This spatial clustering reinforces the assumption that low-income populations lived near industrial workplaces due to limited transportation means, which the HOLC subsequently used as a justification for lower investment security.

				<img src="./visuals/industrial_grades_suburbs.jpg" alt="Industrial Intersection in Outer Cities">
				<figcaption>
					<strong>Suburban Industrial Variations:</strong> In smaller industrial hubs like <strong>Salem</strong> and <strong>Lynn</strong>, the trend is more varied. Unlike the urban core, industrial areas in these cities occasionally intersect with 'A' or 'B' residential zones. This likely reflects a less condensed social fabric in smaller municipalities, where the rigid spatial segregation of the urban center was not yet fully realized.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p>
				This analysis demonstrates that redlining in Greater Boston was not merely a set of disconnected ratings but a systematic geographic project that fundamentally penalized urban density and industrial proximity. A primary lesson learned is the spatial penalty enforced by the HOLC: neighborhoods in the urban core, such as Boston, Chelsea, and Everett, were disproportionately redlined, with Boston seeing 30.7% of its areas graded as "Hazardous". In contrast, suburban municipalities like Winchester were insulated from these designations, with 0% of their area receiving a 'C' or 'D' grade. This geographic gradient effectively subsidized the suburban home-building spree for white populations while systematically denying investment to minority and low-income groups anchored in the city centers.

				Furthermore, the study reveals a definitive spatial correlation between industrial zoning and residential disinvestment. The proximity analysis confirms that Grade D neighborhoods were often physically engulfed by industrial sites, maintaining a median distance of 0.0 miles from factories, compared to an insulation distance of nearly 2 miles for "Best" (A) rated areas. While some smaller industrial hubs like Salem and Lynn showed more varied social fabrics where industrial and high-grade residential zones overlapped, the urban core exhibited a rigid adjacency between labor, industry, and low HOLC grades. These findings underscore how planners utilized land-use patterns to codify racial and economic segregation, creating a process of urban deterioration that remains visible in Boston’s landscape today.
